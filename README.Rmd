### What can this package do for you?
The `quadkeyr` R package presents a comprehensive toolkit 
tailored for generating raster images from Quadkey-Identified data
within [Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system). 
Designed to integrate Quadkey-Identified data into R workflows,
this package facilitates the creation of QuadKey grids and raster images
and introduces specialized functions for
the processing of [Meta Mobility data, previously referred to as Facebook mobility data](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).

### What are QuadKeys in Tile Maps?
Tile maps divide the Earth's surface into a grid of tiles, 
with each tile corresponding to a specific geographic area
at various zoom levels. 

QuadKeys represent a location on a map by
encoding its hierarchical spatial position 
as a sequence of characters. 
They provide an efficient method 
to address and retrieve specific map tiles,
facilitating rapid display within 
mapping applications.

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ropensci/quadkeyr/blob/main/docs/articles/bing_quadkeys.jpg?raw=true")
```
<p style="text-align: center">The QuadKey of any tile starts with the QuadKey of its parent tile (the containing tile at the previous level). Image extracted from Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System webpage.</p>

The goal of `quadkeyr` is to:  
  
1. [**Convert a QuadKey to a Simple Features data.frame (and more)**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_to_sf_conversion.html)
`quadkeyr` provides functions to convert a QuadKey to
a `sf` POINT data.frame or `sf` POLYGON data.frame.
Additionally, it offers all the R functions 
described in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/bing-maps-tile-system) for converting QuadKeys to and from tiles, pixels, and geographic coordinates.

```{r w1, echo = FALSE, out.width= "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/workflow_quadkey.png")
```
  
2. [**Generate Raster Images from Quadkey-Identified Data**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_identified_data_to_raster.html)
Complete a grid of QuadKeys within a specified area and zoom level, 
and create a `stars` raster. 
You can also directly convert QuadKeys in a data.frame column
into an `sf` POLYGON data.frame.
  
```{r w2, echo = FALSE, out.width= "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/workflow_raster.png")
```

3. [**Convert Meta (Facebook) Mobility QuadKey-identified Datasets into Raster  Files**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/facebook_mobility_csvs_to_raster_files.html)
Convert Meta (Facebook) mobility data `.csv` files into `.tif` files
by day and hour reported.
  
```{r w3, echo = FALSE, out.width= "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/workflow_facebook.png")
```

4. [**Offer an App for visualizing QuadKeys on a map**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_visualization_app.html)
Introduce a QuadKey visualization application enabling users 
to validate function outcomes.
