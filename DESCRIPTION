Description: A set of functions of increasing complexity allows users to
  (1) convert QuadKey-identified datasets, 
  based on 'Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System', into Simple Features data frames,
  (2) transform Simple Features data frames into rasters, and 
  (3) process multiple 'Meta' ('Facebook') QuadKey-identified human mobility files
  directly into raster files.
