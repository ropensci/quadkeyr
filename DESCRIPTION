Description: A set of functions of increasing complexity allows users to
  (1) convert QuadKey-identified datasets, 
  based on Microsoft's Bing Maps Tile System, into Simple Features data frames,
  (2) transform Simple Features data frames into rasters, and 
  (3) process multiple Meta (Facebook) QuadKey-identified human mobility files
  directly into raster files.
